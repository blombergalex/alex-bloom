Submission:
A written proposal descripting the features & functionality of the application
Screen shots are encouraged to clearly communicate what the application should do
A link to a github repo that (in addition to the 'base' files created by your choice of react framework) contains:

one "ReadMe" file for your proposal​
one test directory that contains all the tests you have written
NO OTHER files should be included. Just a read me and tests inside a test dir​ectory


A presentation to the class of your application and how it works. Presentations will take place on Tuesday September 10. Presentations are mandatory, if you cannot be there you must submit a short video showing your site.



Pay attention to the submission. I should be able to clone your project, run npm install and the only code you have written will be tests inside a __test__ directory, Do not submit any components, I only want the tests.



It is advisable to create one project to develop the application and tests, then when you are finished copy JUST the test to another project for submission.
