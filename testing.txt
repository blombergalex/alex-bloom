SUBMISSION
A written proposal descripting the features & functionality of the application
Screen shots are encouraged to clearly communicate what the application should do
A link to a github repo that (in addition to the 'base' files created by your choice of react framework) contains:

one "ReadMe" file for your proposal​
one test directory that contains all the tests you have written
NO OTHER files should be included. Just a read me and tests inside a test dir​ectory
 - PUBLIC folder with IMAGES FOLDER
 - UTILS like types file and data

 create new project:
 - install testing stuff ie npm i after cloning original project to make sure the test configuration is done
 - remove all components and contents of layout and home
 - create __test__ folder in src folder and move all tests there
 - git init - create repo - handin link to repo with tests, not link to live site
    -- DO NOT hand in any components
- readme with screen shots and explanation of how it works (ie Portfolio site, sections, favourite functionality (heart turns orange and favourite saved in favourites list that appears only when there are favourites), scroll top functionality)

A presentation to the class of your application and how it works. Presentations will take place on Tuesday September 10. Presentations are mandatory, if you cannot be there you must submit a short video showing your site.



Pay attention to the submission. I should be able to clone your project, run npm install and the only code you have written will be tests inside a __test__ directory, Do not submit any components, I only want the tests.



It is advisable to create one project to develop the application and tests, then when you are finished copy JUST the test to another project for submission.
